# 🩺 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of different diseases based on patient symptoms using supervised machine learning algorithms.  
It applies data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and multiple classification models to assist in early detection.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values, encoding)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Implementation of ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Performance evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix)
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
- Symptom-based disease prediction

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - scikit-learn (ML models, evaluation metrics)
  - Pandas & NumPy (data preprocessing and numerical analysis)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (data visualization)
  - Jupyter Notebook (experiments and results)
